# CS4653-Oracle
Reverse engineering team 06 semester project (Shane, Humberto, Jared)

Project Task:
Reverse engineer the decryption algorithm in DTool.exe and then write a C/C++ program that will properly encrypt an arbitrary file with an arbitrary password. 
The resulting file should be able to be decrypted with DTool.exe without ANY modification to DTool.exe.

Overview:
* main.cpp - Code template from Main_Students.cpp that was included with the original project docs, modified for use with this project
* SHA-256.cpp - SHA256 encryption algorithm written in C++
* SHA-256.h - Project header
